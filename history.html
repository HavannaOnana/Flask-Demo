    <p class="main_text">The first official World Cup was played in Uruguay 1930, 
        and since when the tournament has been held 
        every fourth year (with exceptions for interruption 
        due to the Second World War). There were, however, 
        unofficial pre-FIFA World Cups already in the late 1800s, 
        in a time when only few national teams existed.</p>

        <img class="background_image" src="static/images/past.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="background_text">Before the World Cup was inaugurated, 
            the football tournament arranged as part of 
            the Summer Olympics was given the most prestige. 
            But in the 1920s, the game was facing a transition to 
            professionalism that wasn't consistent with the Olympic spirit. 
            Therefore, the government body, FIFA, made plans to organize a World Cup. 
            The decision of arranging the first 
            edition was officially declared on May 26, 1928.</p>

        <img class="current_image" src="static/images/argentina.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="current_text">The first official World Cup was played in Uruguay 1930, 
            and since when the tournament has been held every fourth year 
            (with exceptions for interruption due to the Second World War). 
            There were, however, unofficial pre-FIFA World Cups already in the late 1800s, 
            in a time when only few national teams existed. 
            Another unofficial "world cup" arranged before 1930 was 
            Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy held in 1909 and 1911. Besides that, 
            the Summer Olympic football competitions would be a mark of which the 
            best national teams were before 1930. The Olympic tournaments consisted, 
            however, only of amateur teams â€“ the World Cup became the "real deal".</p>
