    <h1 class="text"> WINNERS OF THE WORLD CUP </h1>
    <p class="main_text"> The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, 
        is an international association football 
        competition between the senior men's national teams of the members of 
        the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. 
        The tournament has been held every 
        four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, with the 
        exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War. 
        The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament.</p>
